# Tic-tac-toe
This Python program brings the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to the console. Players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their chosen symbol. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move and displays the current state of the board. With a simple yet engaging user interface.
